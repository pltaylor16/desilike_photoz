; This is the priors file (https://cosmosis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/parameter_files/priors_ini.html)
; Here we set priors that aren't TopHats (as those priors are already set in the values file)
; We set the Gaussian parameters as follows

; Uncorrelated Gaussian priors on the uncertainty in the DES Y3 mean redshift per tomographic bin
[wl_photoz_errors_des]
bias_1 = gaussian 0.00 0.018
bias_2 = gaussian 0.00 0.015
bias_3 = gaussian 0.00 0.011
bias_4 = gaussian 0.0  0.017

; Uncorrelated Gaussian priors on the uncertainty in the DES Y3 shear calibration per tomographic bin
; Note that the KiDS shear calibration uncertainty is included in the covariance matrix
